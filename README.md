editorconfig-lint
=================

Lint code for compliance with an editorconfig

### TODO ideas (PRs welcome!)
* Read files directly (both files to lint and .editorconfig)
* Allow user to pass in their own validators
* Allow code to override a rule (eg jshint lets you say "ignore this rule for this section or file"
* More validations
** Using one var statement or many
** `{foo: bar}` or `{ foo: bar }`
** Line length
